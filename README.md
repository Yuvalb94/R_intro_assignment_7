# Intro to R course

This course in an interactive course that teaches the basics of coding languages. Specifically the R language.
What is interesting in this course that it is taught not only as a lecture but also by self-prompting a pre-trained ChatGPT that does the actual teaching using the prompts that the students get and feed to the chat.

## Assignment 7
In this assignment we were asked to create this repository and commit to it two versions of assignment 1 - the original one and an upgraded one using stuff that we learned in the course since.
